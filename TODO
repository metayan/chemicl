1. SMILES

1.1. Configuration around double bonds

This basically works, but we're not storing the information in the
cleanest way. Currently, we just ape the SMILES bond info. We might
want to do something smarter here.

1.2. Chiral centers

1.3. Canonicalization

1.4. DONE - Wildcard "atoms"

This should be working. Tests to verify this would be nice.

1.5. SMILES Aromaticity Rules

The SMILES aromaticity stuff is kind of a mess, but we need to support
it, at the very least for canonicalization (and for proper
visualization and searching, at some point). Currently we don't really
do anything here.
